# Definition of done
- [ ] The code is **written in a clean, simple and readable** way
- [ ] The code is **tested** (behaviour mode, don't test the code itself)
- [ ] The code has proper **technical documentation** (if necessary for public methods, don't say the obvious)
- [ ] The **code is reviewed** and accepted by at least one other developer
- [ ] The feature branch is **merged into the develop** branch (use proper gitflow mechanisms)
- [ ] The **feature branch is deleted** (local and remote) after merging
- [ ] The **issue is synced** with the feature branch in Jira
- [ ] For important parts of the framework, add markdown documentation to the `doc` folder to explain concepts.
